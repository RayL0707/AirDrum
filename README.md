# Finger Conductor
## IoT Final Project
  This is a leap motion application that is controlled by hands, and could create drum/piano music based on the motion of hands. By using two hands, the device could create drum music based on position and velocity data of hands. By catching five fingers data, the device could also create simple piano music.
